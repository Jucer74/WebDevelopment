## Purpose: Next.js frontend for BMX

# BMX Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project consists of consuming an API that offers endpoints to create users, bikes and this API has something special which is an authentication, authorization, through the JWT token, we have an
architecture for this project based on unique components and responsibilities for each task . We have 2 cruds: user and bike, like a login and a registration. It has a global store to manage the
application data that is managed with redux and with this we can
manage the global states throughout the application.

## Getting Started with Next.js

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
