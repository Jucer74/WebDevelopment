## This project BmxApp applicate the concepts of the course of WebDevelopment
I applied the concepts seen in the WebDev repository workshop, which consisted of the fundamentals for the development of web pages, client and server, such as the use of relational databases. Integration of technologies such as authentication and authorization thanks to the JWT and security for the projects. In other parts we use the data contexts in the frontend applications as in the backend API, which is how the data of our applications is managed. Something curious is that redux was used in the frontend with next and react, which is somewhat different from How can you maintain the data of an application. And finally the way to expose and consume services.

This project contains the following parts:

### Backend
- [x] [BmxApi]

### Frontend
- [x] [FrontendBmxAspMVC]
- [x] [frontendbmxnext]
